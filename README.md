# MVVMNavigation.WPF
This library includes basic needs for creating an MVVM application. There are implementations of INotifyPropertyChanged in ObservableObject, and multiple implementations of ICommand in RelayCommand and RelayCommandAsync.

There are also contracts(and their implementations) for Navigation and DialogServices. For now, the implementations are for WPF only, more might be added in the future!
